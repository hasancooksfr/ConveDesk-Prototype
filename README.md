# ConveDesk AI - Conversation to Customer Platform for SMBs

ConveDesk AI is an intelligent Conversation-to-Customer platform that converts inbound customer inquiries from messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram into confirmed bookings and completed payments automatically.

Built for small and medium businesses, ConveDesk eliminates manual lead handling and enables real-time customer acquisition through AI-driven conversational workflows.

## Problem Statement

Small businesses in India receive the majority of their customer inquiries through conversational platforms such as:

- WhatsApp  
- Instagram Direct Messages  
- Email  

However, due to:

- Delayed responses  
- Lack of structured follow-ups  
- No integrated booking workflows  
- No payment collection system  

Businesses lose a significant portion of potential customers before conversion.

Traditional CRM systems are not optimized for conversational lead intake, resulting in missed revenue opportunities.

- Understands user intent
